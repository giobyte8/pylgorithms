""" Youâ€™re given an array of positive integers, weights, where \
    weights[i] is the weight of the i th index. \

    Write a function, Pick Index(), which performs weighted random
    selection to return an index from the weights array. The larger
    the value of weights[i], the heavier the weight is, and the higher
    the chances of its index being picked.

    Suppose that the array consists of the weights [12, 84, 35]. In this
    case, the probabilities of picking the indexes will be as follows:

    Index 0:
    12/(12+84+35) = 9.2%

    Index 1:
    84/(12+84+35)=64.1%

    Index 2:
    35/(12+84+35)=26.7%
